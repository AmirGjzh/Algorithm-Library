# Algorithm Library

Short collection of competitive-programming algorithms and data-structures — handy reference implementations and templates.

## Contents
- ~70 source files organized by topic (graphs, DP, geometry, algebra, etc.).
- Mostly C++ solutions; also some language-agnostic examples and helper snippets.

## How to use
1. Open the folder for the algorithm you need.
2. Most solutions are standalone source files. Compile/run with the usual toolchain:
   - C++: `g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -O2 -o file && ./file`
   - Python: `python3 file.py`
   - Java: `javac File.java && java File`
3. Add problem-specific input where needed or modify the template for testing.

## Sources & Credits
Learned from online competitive-programming resources (e.g. CP-algorithms, USACO) and community tutorials. If any code needs attribution, please open an issue or PR.

## Contributing
- Name files clearly and add short comments.
- Group algorithms by category (graphs, trees, geometry, DP, etc.).
- Add a `README.md` in subfolders describing contained solutions.

## License
Provided as-is for learning and reference. Add a LICENSE file if you want to allow reuse.
